2. Parent-student linking

### Medium Priority (Week 3-4)
3. Reporting & analytics dashboard
4. Bulk operations

### Low Priority (Week 5)
5. Enhanced academic structure features
6. Final testing & optimization

## Success Criteria
- All new components have proper TypeScript typing
- Components are reusable and follow existing design system
- Proper state management with React hooks
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Proper loading and empty states
- Consistent UI/UX with existing components
- Role-based access control implemented
- Data validation on client side
- Comprehensive test data for all mock implementations
- Clear path for future API integration

## Important Notes
- DO NOT reimplement features that are already working (see list above)
- Focus only on the missing features identified above
- Maintain consistency with existing code style and patterns
- Use the same UI components and design patterns as existing pages
- Ensure all new features follow role-based access control
